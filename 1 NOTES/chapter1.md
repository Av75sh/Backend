# NPM vs NPX
## NPM (node package manager) 
used to install the code locally/globally then run in your system.
It is used to install, manage, handle depedencies for node js project.

``` Example 
npm install -g nodemon       -> Install the nodemon globally
nodemon app.js               -> runs the app with nodemon 
```


## Npx (node package executor)
It is a command line utility which runs the program without installing it

``` Example
npx nodemon app.js              -> runs nodemon directly without installing it
```

### HTTP
We don't need to do npm everytime so we use `[npx nodemon file.js]` 
this ('http) => import the build-in http module in node js which allow to create http server

---

1. ### Packages :-
        is the reusalable code  [npmjs website for packages]
        Ex:- a particular code must be common in all node js files so we don't need to write it again we use the node packages

2. ### Package.json / Package-lock.json :-
        (for developers) => tells us the incredients presnt in our code conatins all the detailed explanation of package.json


## V8 Vs Node Vs Express:
1. `V8` is a JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code, while Node.js is a runtime environment built around V8 to run JavaScript outside the browser.

2. `Node.js` provides the environment and tools to run JavaScript on the server side, but it doesnâ€™t provide specific tools for building web servers or managing HTTP requests. That's where Express comes in.

        Build on top of V8 engine

3. `Express` is a framework built on top of Node.js that provides additional functionality for creating web servers and APIs more easily.
        
        Express is a web application framework built on top of Node.js.
